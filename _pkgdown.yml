  - title: Font Awesome Icon Insertion
    desc: >
      If you'd like to insert a Font Awesome icon somewhere it's needed, the
      best option is via the `fa()` function. Should you need a PNG version of
      the icon, then `fa_png()` is best for that. Want to know which icons are
      included in the package? Use `fa_info()` to get an informative table on
      This.
